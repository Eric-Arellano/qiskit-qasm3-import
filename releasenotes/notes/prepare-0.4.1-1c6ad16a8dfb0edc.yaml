    The 0.4.1 release relaxes the upper bound on the Qiskit dependency, since this package is
    developed in conjunction with Qiskit itself and is tested in its CI, while Qiskit continues to
    use this.  There are no expected changes in Qiskit 1.0 that will stop this package working,
    though Qiskit is expected to change its default supplier of OpenQASM 3 parsing.
